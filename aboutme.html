    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Joey Shi</h2>
    <p>
      I am a senior at SITHS. I've been a computer science hater for a while now
      (tried it multiple times, couldn't really get into it), but I'm taking
      this class to get better at coding and gain some CS intuition to better
      aid me in my SERP project (on computational genomics). I wish to study
      chemistry and continue doing research in the future, maybe for CRISPR
      technology or nanoparticles. I've also been playing the violin for a long
      time, do brush calligraphy, and like designing/art in general.
